/*
We can solve this problem using BFS as well. The idea is going to be same. We use a visited matrix to keep track if the visited cells and apply 
the standard queue based BFS algorithm to count islands. We increment the count whenever we see an unvisited vertex after the previous call. 
The time complexity and auxiliary space are going to be same as DFS. However this implementation would be faster as we do not have recursion overhead.
